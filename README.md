# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

- Developed a binary classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning algorithms.

- Handled imbalanced dataset (~0.17% fraud) using SMOTE for oversampling the minority class.

- Implemented and compared models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN using Stratified K-Fold cross-validation for model robustness.

- Achieved an F1-score of 0.95 and ROC-AUC of 0.99 with the Logistic Regression model.

- Visualized confusion matrices and precision-recall curves to evaluate model performance.

- Applied feature scaling and dimensionality reduction (SVM) for optimized computation and accuracy.
